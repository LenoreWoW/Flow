To make your FlowBot repository public on GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository "FlowBot"
   - Make sure it's set to "Public"
   - Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Once the repository is created, run these commands in your terminal:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FlowBot.git
   git push -u origin main
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```
   
   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

3. After pushing, your code will be available at:
   - Repository: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FlowBot
   - Live site: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/FlowBot/

4. To enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" 
   - Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
   - Select "gh-pages" branch as the source
   - Click "Save"

Your FlowBot landing page will now be public and accessible to anyone!
